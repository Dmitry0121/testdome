 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 Problem statement:
    A TrainComposition is built by attaching and detaching wagons from the left and the right sides, efficiently with respect to time used.

    For example, if we start by attaching wagon 7 from the left followed by attaching wagon 13, again from the left, we get a composition of two wagons (13 and 7 from left to right). Now the first wagon that can be detached from the right is 7 and the first that can be detached from the left is 13.

    Implement a TrainComposition that models this problem.

        deque.addLast(wagonId);

        final Integer wagon = deque.pollFirst();
        return wagon == null? 0 : wagon;

        System.out.println(tree.detachWagonFromRight()); // 7
