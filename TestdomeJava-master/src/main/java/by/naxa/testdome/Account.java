 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 Problem statement:
    Using JUnit Assert class, write tests for the Account class that cover the following cases:

    * The deposit and withdraw methods will not accept negative numbers.
    * Account cannot overstep its overdraft limit.
    * The deposit and withdraw methods will deposit or withdraw the correct amount, respectively.
    * The withdraw and deposit methods return the correct results.
